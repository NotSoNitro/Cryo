# Cryo
The AIO GUI for Roblox!
## About
Cryo was based on a GUI I saw floating around when I used to exploit the game (i've retired from this and now use the experiance for anti-cheat systems) I felt pretty insipred by it and decided to recreate it for myself but for the good of the community instead. Cryo was only used by friends and people i knew so not much success came out of it so i became burntout. But now i'm back and making a rewrite! (and yes this includes a new UI design which will be unique :D)

## UI
Cryo's UI was based on the GUI I saw but I can't find now so UI is credited to them but i did manage to recreate it to the best of my abilities with some changes to make it somewhat unique(?) and the executor UI which was made by me as it was something I thought would be cool and useful

Everything else (except the loadstring library) was made by me
